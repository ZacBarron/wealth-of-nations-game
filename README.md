# Wealth of Nations: The Trading Card Game

**Wealth of Nations: The Trading Card Game** is a blockchain-based strategy game that brings the principles of economics and global trade to life in a competitive, immersive experience. Players build and manage their economies by collecting resource cards, deploying powerful leaders, and engaging in strategic trades to outwit their opponents. Drawing inspiration from Adam Smith‚Äôs *The Wealth of Nations*, the game challenges players to balance production, trade, and diplomacy as they race to dominate the global economy.

This project was built as part of the **Alchemy Track** at the **Pool Hacker House** during **Devcon 7 SEA** in **Bangkok, November 2024**. The rules for the Alchemy Track required participants to use **Alchemy Account Kit** and encouraged use of their gas sponsorship functionality and other Alchemy APIs (such as their **NFT API** or **Transfer API**) to create an application. I decided to design this trading card game leveraging NFT mechanics to demonstrate the potential of blockchain in gaming.

## Core Gameplay

- **Collect Resources**: Gather key economic assets such as Gold, Steel, Food, Energy, and Technology to fuel your industries and grow your wealth.
- **Trade Strategically**: Negotiate with other players in dynamic trade sessions where supply and demand dictate market prices.
- **Deploy Leaders and Policies**: Play influential leaders and groundbreaking policies to gain competitive advantages and disrupt your rivals.
- **Build Industries**: Convert resources into powerful industries that generate ongoing wealth and economic influence.
- **Adapt to Global Events**: Navigate through event cards that simulate real-world economic challenges, such as recessions, trade wars, and technological breakthroughs.

## Blockchain Integration

Wealth of Nations leverages the power of blockchain to:

- **Ensure True Ownership**: Each card is an NFT, allowing players to trade, sell, or collect their assets freely.
- **Enable Transparent Gameplay**: All transactions and game mechanics are verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Introduce Gas Sponsorship**: Alchemy's gas sponsorship feature ensures seamless transactions without requiring players to manage gas fees manually.

## Inspiration and Themes

- Inspired by Adam Smith‚Äôs foundational economic theories, the game explores concepts like the division of labor, free markets, and international trade.
- Historical and modern leaders, industries, and economies serve as the foundation for card designs, blending realism with strategic gameplay.
- Each card tells a story, tying its functionality to a unique historical or thematic narrative.

## Project Status

### Completed Work
- ‚úÖ **Basic frontend setup** with Next.js (login and logout pages)
- ‚úÖ **Alchemy Account Kit integration** for login/logout
- ‚úÖ **Starter pack NFT contract** deployed & metadata/image published to IPFS
- ‚úÖ **NFT minting functionality** (claim pack)
- ‚úÖ **Manage frontend** to only allow one starter pack per user account
- ‚úÖ **Minting-related success/failure messages** and error handling
- ‚úÖ **Placeholder NFT metadata/image** for when it can't be retrieved from IPFS
- ‚úÖ **Fix NFT metadata retrieval** and ensure proper rendering using Alchemy's NFT API (resolving issues with incorrect tokenURI formatting).
- ‚úÖ **Create dashboard** update the logged in experience to show a dashboard with starter pack, activity, stats, and navigation links.

### Immediate Priorities
üìù **Flesh out placeholder navigation links and sections**:
  - Build out rest of logged in experience.
üìù **Loading states for collection items**:
  - Display loading state while retrieving NFT metadata and image.
- üìù **Build a "My Items" section**:
  - Display owned packs with metadata (name, image, description).
  - Add a placeholder "Open Pack" button for future functionality.
- üìù **Create responsive styling** for the "My Items" section using Tailwind CSS.

### Mid-Term Goals
- üìù **Implement the "Open Pack" mechanic**:
  - Burn the pack NFT.
  - Mint and reveal 5 individual cards (NFTs).
  - Display revealed cards in the "My Items" section.

### Long-Term Goals
- üìù **Design and implement the card trading system**:
  - Enable players to trade NFTs with each other.
