# Wealth of Nations: The Trading Card Game

**Wealth of Nations: The Trading Card Game** is a blockchain-based strategy game that brings the principles of economics and global trade to life in a competitive, immersive experience. Players build and manage their economies by collecting resource cards, deploying powerful leaders, and engaging in strategic trades to outwit their opponents. Drawing inspiration from Adam Smith‚Äôs *The Wealth of Nations*, the game challenges players to balance production, trade, and diplomacy as they race to dominate the global economy.

This project was built as part of the **Alchemy Track** at the **Pool Hacker House** during **Devcon 7 SEA** in **Bangkok, November 2024**. The rules for the Alchemy Track required participants to use **Alchemy Account Kit** and encouraged use of their gas sponsorship functionality and other Alchemy APIs (such as their **NFT API** or **Transfer API**) to create an application. I decided to design this trading card game leveraging NFT mechanics to demonstrate the potential of blockchain in gaming.

## Core Gameplay

- **Collect Resources**: Gather key economic assets such as Gold, Steel, Food, Energy, and Technology to fuel your industries and grow your wealth.
- **Trade Strategically**: Negotiate with other players in dynamic trade sessions where supply and demand dictate market prices.
- **Deploy Leaders and Policies**: Play influential leaders and groundbreaking policies to gain competitive advantages and disrupt your rivals.
- **Build Industries**: Convert resources into powerful industries that generate ongoing wealth and economic influence.
- **Adapt to Global Events**: Navigate through event cards that simulate real-world economic challenges, such as recessions, trade wars, and technological breakthroughs.

## Blockchain Integration

Wealth of Nations leverages the power of blockchain to:

- **Ensure True Ownership**: Each card is an NFT, allowing players to trade, sell, or collect their assets freely.
- **Enable Transparent Gameplay**: All transactions and game mechanics are verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Introduce Gas Sponsorship**: Alchemy's gas sponsorship feature ensures seamless transactions without requiring players to manage gas fees manually.

## Inspiration and Themes

- Inspired by Adam Smith‚Äôs foundational economic theories, the game explores concepts like the division of labor, free markets, and international trade.
- Historical and modern leaders, industries, and economies serve as the foundation for card designs, blending realism with strategic gameplay.
- Each card tells a story, tying its functionality to a unique historical or thematic narrative.
